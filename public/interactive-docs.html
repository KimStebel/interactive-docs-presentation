# Notebooks

The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.

 * Supports over 40 programming languages
 * Can be used with (almost) all CDS services
 * Can be used to connect services together
 * Can be used for longer examples with more than one request
 * Only viable option for services without a REST API

# Notebooks for documentation

 * Integrate executable code snippets into documentation sites
 * Temporary notebooks (with tmpnb and docker) as an execution engine
 * Used at user groups, meetups, and workshops to provide temporary access to a full system without any installation, runs https://try.jupyter.org/.
 * Works with Docker Swarm, making it easy to scale and keep available
