# Ask questions! Complain!

---

# Agenda

1. What and why?
2. Swagger
3. Notebooks

---

# What is interactive documentation?

User can try the API on the documentation site.
 
---
 
# Why interactive documentation?

Code snippets actually work!

---
 
# Why interactive documentation?

Seems to make developers more likely to contribute code snippets

---
 
# Why interactive documentation?

Learning by doing

---
 
# Why interactive documentation?

Get from "Hey, this seems interesting" to "it works!" in 10 seconds

---
 
# Why interactive documentation?

Drive adoption
   
---

# Swagger

 * Yes, great for reference documentation of REST APIs

But...

 * Not all APIs are RESTful (nor should they be)
 * Client libraries?
 * No meant for guides

---

#  Jupyter Notebooks (ipython notebooks)

The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations.

 * Supports over 40 programming languages
 * Code can produce output such as images, videos, LaTeX, and JavaScript

# Jupyter notebooks

---

# Jupyter Notebooks - but...

 * Developed with academia and education in mind
 * Notebook servers are single user. Each user needs their own notebook server instance
 * Thus, usually run locally or behind a login (e.g. Coursera).
 * How do we use notebooks in documentation? Requirements: No installation, no login

---

# Jupyter Notebooks - so what?

 * It has an API - let's throw away the frontend and use the backend only
 * tmpnb (temporary notebook server) solves the multiuser problem

---

# tmpnb - Temporary Notebook Server

 * [tmpnb](https://github.com/jupyter/tmpnb) manages a pool of docker containers and assigns one to each user
 * used to provide temporary notebooks
 * used at user groups, meetups, and workshops to provide temporary access to a full system without any installation
 * runs https://try.jupyter.org/.

# tmpnb - based on Docker

 * Docker! Yay!
 * You can create your own Docker image for the Jupyter container
 * Base images available from Jupyter
 * You can add language kernels, libraries, data sets...

---

# Thebe - An alternative Notebook UI

Tmpnb solves the multiuser problem, but it still has the same clunky UI.

[Thebe](https://github.com/oreillymedia/thebe) is a Javascript library that uses tmpnb as a backend for code execution.

It can be integrated into any website like this:

```
$(function(){
    new Thebe({
        selector: "code.python",
        kernel_name: "python2",
        url: "http://some.tmpnb.server.com:8000"
    });
});
```

Any `<code class="python">` tag will have a run button added.

```
<code class="python">
    import cloudant
    ...
</code>
```
