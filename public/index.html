# Interactive documentation

 * What? Let users try out services while browsing the documentation site
 * Why?
   * Discover, **Try**, and buy
   * Learning by doing
   * Already works well in terms of conversion rate
   * Because we can

# Swagger

# Swagger - Pros and cons

## Pros

 * Lets users try requests from the browser
 * Automatically creates API reference from Swagger spec file
 * Encourages collaboration between software developers and information developers

## Cons

 * Only works with REST APIs, but less than half of CDS services have one
 * One request at a time, one service at a time
 * Issues with accessibility and translation

# Notebooks

The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.

 * Supports over 40 programming languages
 * Code can produce rich output such as images, videos, LaTeX, and JavaScript
 * Supports Spark, from Python, R and Scala

# Notebooks

# Notebooks - but...

 * Notebooks are single user. Each user needs their own notebook server instance, usually run locally or behind a login (e.g. spark service, coursera).
 * How do we use notebooks in documentation/tutorials/demos? Requirements: No installation, no login (still in "discover, try and buy")

# tmpnb - Temporary Notebook Server

 * [tmpnb](https://github.com/jupyter/tmpnb) launches a docker container for each user that requests one.
 * used to provide temporary notebooks
 * used at user groups, meetups, and workshops to provide temporary access to a full system without any installation
 * runs https://try.jupyter.org/.
 * we can run it on Bluemix...

# Thebe - An alternative Notebook UI

Tmpnb solves the multiuser problem, but it still has the same clunky UI.

[Thebe](https://github.com/oreillymedia/thebe) is a Javascript library that uses tmpnb as a backend for code execution.

It can be integrated into any website like this:

```
$(function(){
    new Thebe({
        selector: "code.python",
        kernel_name: "python2",
        url:"http://some.tmpnb.server.com:8000"
    });
});
```

Any `<code class="python">` tag will have a run button added.

```
<code class="python">
    import cloudant
    ...
</code>
```
